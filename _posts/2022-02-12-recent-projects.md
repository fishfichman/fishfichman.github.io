#2021 Was a Big Year

2021 was a big year of changes. My first publication, my first first-author publication, and two more manuscripts were published just this year. I am so proud of these accomplishments, but they would not have happened without all my amazing co-authors from the [OGFL](https://www.ogfishlab.com/), UC Davis, and government and private agencies.

I also experienced some of the hardest times of my life, with my parent's illness completely disrupting my life for months, but that is for another post.

For now, here are the manuscripts we published in 2021. Enjoy!
