Hi! This is my first attempt at repurposing an existing blog with new text. I am not sure exactly how I will want to use this website, because I am not a blog type of person, and if I were I would likely write them on my lab's website. But, for now, here we are. Maybe I will just use these posts to promote research projects I am working on, new publications, and conferences I will attend or present at. Yee-haw!
