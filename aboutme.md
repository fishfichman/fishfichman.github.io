Hello, World. My name is Rachel Fichman (they/them/theirs) and I am a first year M.S. student at UC Davis in the Graduate Group in Ecology. I'm not sure what I want to do with this site yet, but I figured I'd mess around with it a bit.

### My Research

*WIP* (work in progress)

I am a Graduate Student Researcher for the **Otolith, Geochemistry and Fish Ecology Laboratory** under Dr. Levi S. Lewis. Visit [our website](http://www.hobbslab.com/) to check out all the work we do!

I am also a member of the **Freshwater Ecology Laboratory** under my faculty advisor, Dr. Robert Lusardi. Check out our new website  [here!](https://sites.google.com/view/lusardi-lab/research?authuser=0) 

### My Goals

*WIP*
