I am a second year M.S. student at the University of California, Davis in the [Graduate Group in Ecology](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/). I am advised by Assistant Adjunct Professor, Dr. Lusardi as a member of the **[Freshwater Ecology Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/lusardi-lab/research?authuser=0)**. My thesis research is advised by Dr. Levi Lewis of the **[Otolith, Geochemistry and Fish Ecology Laboratory](http://www.hobbslab.com/)** and focuses on endangered fish species responses to changing environmental conditions in the San Francisco Estuary.
